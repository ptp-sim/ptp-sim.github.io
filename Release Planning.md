# Release Planning

The current release plans for the __ptp-sim__ projects are described below.

## Version 1.0

The initial release of all ptp-sim projects were done in 2016.
After that, the code was basically unmaintained for a few years.
This initial release has been labeled as __v1.0__.
This will be the last version that is hosted on the old location at https://github.com/w-wallner.
Later versions will be published at the new project home at https://github.com/ptp-sim.

## Version 1.1

The initial v1.0 release had some drawbacks: the documentation was not good enough, and some project files were missing.
These drawbacks should be fixed in release __v1.1__.
Version 1.1 will not contain any new features, it will just be a better variant of v1.0.

Planned changes for v1.1:
* Improved documentation
* Fixed project files
* Initial versions of Github site and community forum should be up and running

The goal for v1.1 is that new users should be able to download the code and get to a running PTP simulation with the provided documentation.

## Version 1.2

As of v1.0, the code is only supported on OMNeT\+\+ 4.6, which is itself not well supported on current operating systems.
This is huge hurdle for any new contributors.
To move the project forward, it is of great importance that we get the ptp-sim projects ported to a modern OMNeT\+\+ release.
This will be the goal for __v1.2__.
